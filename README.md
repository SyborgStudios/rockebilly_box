        ## What do I need for the box?
        You should get the following things if you want to gather everything yourself.

        _If you want to support this project, use the links here. It won't make your box more expensive and will give me a small amount._

        ### Internals
        The box is based on the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. It comes with an HDMI port for a touchscreen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and an audio output for speakers. You can power it through a wall adapter or simply with a power bank.
        <br>
        We make it easy and use simple USB-powered speakers and a USB/HDMI touchscreen.
        <br>
        If you have little technical skills and don't want to configure anything, get the suggested parts. Everything will work guaranteed.

        ## The Surroundings
        ### Your Design
        Let your creativity run wild or print the box yourself with my templates.
        <br>
        You can customize your box completely according to your preferences and simply install the internals inside. That's how I started too.
        <br>
        My son won't likely go for the official design quickly. He helped build his wooden box, and it looks pretty awesome.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, the amplifier appearance is a bit too complex for the official design, as the volume control needs to be built. Also, you can't easily rotate the box when you want to play games or watch videos.

        ![Wooden Box](image_url('box/holz_box.jpg')){:class="w-100"}
        
        **The Official Rockebilly Design**
        
        ![Official Design Drawing](image_url('box/complete_box.png')){:class="w-100"}
        
        ![Official Design](image_url('box/box_im_spielzimmer.jpg')){:class="w-100"}

        The box I will offer you will be made of plastic.
        It directs its stereo sound to the sides. This allows you to rotate the box when you want to watch videos or play games.
        If you have access to a 3D printer, you can also print the box yourself.

      ## Step by Step to the Box:
      If you have gathered everything yourself and only need the software, you can download the image for the micro SD card [here](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box).
      <br>
      Use the official [Raspberry Pi software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) to flash the image onto an SD card.
      <br>
      Instructions on how to wire everything and assemble it can be found [here](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box/blob/main/anleitung/anleitung.pdf).

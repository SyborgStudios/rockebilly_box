## Introduction

The Rockebilly Box is an audio box that allows you to easily listen to albums, tracks, playlists, and audiobooks available on Spotify. The project offers a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach, where you can customize and assemble the box yourself.

## Do It Yourself

Everything you need can be obtained from me: the internals (electronics), the box around it, and the software.
Depending on how customized you want your box, you can source everything yourself and only get the software here. Or just the internals, or just the box... you get the idea.

So, "I can't do it" doesn't count.


## What can the Rockebilly Box do?

Play albums, tracks, playlists, and audiobooks
Wi-Fi or Ethernet
Battery or mains operation
Bluetooth support for headphones, speakers, etc.
Expandable as a box for games, videos, etc.
Super easy to repair and completely modular. If a part breaks, you can easily replace it.

## Requirements

To build the Rockebilly Box, you will need the following components:

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4 GB RAM is sufficient)
- Raspberry Pi power adapter
- Micro SD card
- USB-powered speakers
- HDMI touchscreen
- 4 push buttons for Power, Back, Volume Up, and Volume Down
- 40-pin flat ribbon cable
- Toggle switch for Power
- USB port
- Cable clamps

For detailed information and suggested links, refer to the [Requirements](#requirements) section in the project.

## The Surroundings

The surroundings of the Rockebilly Box allow you to customize the design according to your preferences. Whether you choose the official design or create your own, the README provides information on how to approach the surroundings.

## Templates

Download the templates for creating the box:

- [Lid STL](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box/blob/main/3d_models/stl/top.stl)
- [Side Grille STL](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box/blob/main/3d_models/stl/side.stl)
- [Operation and Assembly Manual (PDF)](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box/blob/main/anleitung/anleitung.pdf)

## Step by Step

If you have gathered everything yourself and only need the software, you can download the image for the micro SD card [here](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box). Use the official [Raspberry Pi software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) to flash the image onto an SD card. Detailed instructions on how to wire everything and assemble it can be found in the [PDF](https://github.com/SyborgStudios/rockebilly_box/blob/main/anleitung/anleitung.pdf).
